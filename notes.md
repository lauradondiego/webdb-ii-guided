1. migrations === preferred
2. using a gui/cli tool
3. using sql scripts

- v1: record client's phone number
- v2: 2002, record client's email
- v3: 2007, contact info (type, value), multiple emails/phones/socia media accounts

* strings will be VARCHAR
* if you don't have knex installed globally, npx knex init
* if you want to install globally npm i -g knex
